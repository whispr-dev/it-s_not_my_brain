# it's_not_my_brain
 it was my best attemppt at actually running my brain so far


2408252236

so this is the results of my most successful yet attempt toactually run my wonderful dream design of ai brain...

it's a GAN but three ways - based on a core of an RNN/CNN/LSTMall lorded o ver by a GAN, but synchronised by a simulated ganglion which itself has a cellular automaton as its control layer which is featuring crosstalk to try and speed things up a lil! :O


- most all of this collection is wofram notebooks but the code is essentially a basic setup that can be encoded on any ai capable system or language.
- it's incredibly compact code and even the math is quite crunched down - as code it is imp-ressively compact even, but ofc with wolfram you dont have to worry about stuff like that.
- again, being wolfram notebooks they dont require dependencies or libraries or aything and should just run as is.
there's only one drawback: i never got audio processing to work and there's a few fals starts in there just to throw ya!

so, having done the initial tidy up it's quite clear there's a significant lack of dcumentation - hen it's fortunate that it's mostly wolfram notebooks.

- this is all an aim to test the three way gan with ganglion i n specific - that which later went on to be brain of jellfsh and flbsterpot.
- the full brain structure is variations upon ((RNN/CNN/LSTM)* <ca control layer + anglion> * GAN))crosstalk.
- although applied further ina number of other projects this is still actually the most actively uptio date and well tested version of this encodfed anywhere.
-  needs a training cycle and further follow on testing.
