# it's_not_my_brain
 it was my best attemppt at actually running my brain so far


2408252236

so this is the results of my most successful yet attempt toactually run my wonderful dream design of ai brain...

it's a GAN but three ways - based on a core of an RNN/CNN/LSTMall lorded o ver by a GAN, but synchronised by a simulated ganglion which itself has a cellular automaton as its control layer which is featuring crosstalk to try and speed things up a lil! :O


- most all of this collection is wofram notebooks but the code is essentially a basic setup that can be encoded on any ai capable system or language.
- it's incredibly compact code and even the math is quite crunched down - as code it is imp-ressively compact even, but ofc with wolfram you dont have to worry about stuff like that.
- again, being wolfram notebooks they dont require dependencies or libraries or aything and should just run as is.
there's only one drawback: i never got audio processing to work and there's a few fals starts in there just to throw ya!
